## About Me

I am a PhD student in the Crall and Trowbridge labs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am interested in thermal ecology of insects and the impacts of disturbance ecology on plant-insect interactions. I am most excited by trying to understand how these stressors differentially affect insects throughout ontogeny. I am studying effects of wildfire ash deposition on plant-herbivore interactions with Manduca sexta, and the effects of heatwaves on social and solitary bee biology and behavior. Iâ€™m passionate about science communication and increasing diversity in ecology. Outside of research I like  talking about research, taking long walks, riding my horse, and trying not to fall of my bike!
